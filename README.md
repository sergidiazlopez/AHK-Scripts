Some Scripts that I use daily on windows. Some of these are years old.
Needs [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)

### my-hotkeys.ahk

CTRL + WIN + Mouse Wheel to change Windows Virtual Desktops

WIN+ Mouse Wheel for Volume Control

WIN + Middle Click for muting audio

Mute/Unmute Microphone and Line in with WIN + Side mouse buttons

CTRL + ALT + T

WIN + ENTER for Prtsc


### ResolutionChanger.ahk
Hotkeys to change resolution and/or refresh rate. You can edit the file to specify the resolutions.

WIN + Home = 1080p 144hz

WIN + PgUp = 1080p 120hz

WIN + PgDn = 1080p 60hz

WIN + End = 1620p 144hz (NVIDIA DLDSR)

Useful for games that don't let you choose higher resolutions from DLDSR/DSR or different refresh rates.

### AutoResolutionChanger.ahk
Changes the resolution when it detects a specific game running.

Old script, needs more work.
