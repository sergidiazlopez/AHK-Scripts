Some Scripts that I use daily on windows. Some of these are years old.
Needs [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)

### ResolutionChanger.ahk
Hotkeys to change resolution and/or refresh rate. You can edit the file to specify the resolutions.

|       HOTKEY		|       WHAT IT DOES			|
|-------------------|-------------------------------|
|WIN + Home			|1080p 144hz					|
|WIN + PgUp			|1080p 120hz					|
|WIN + PgDn			|1080p 60hz						|
|WIN + End 			|1620p 144hz (NVIDIA DLDSR)  	|
|WIN + Ctrl + End 	|4K 144hz (NVIDIA DSR)  		|

Useful for games that don't let you choose higher resolutions from DLDSR/DSR or different refresh rates.

### AutoResolutionChanger.ahk
Changes the resolution when it detects a specific game running.

Old script, needs more work.
